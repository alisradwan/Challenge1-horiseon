## Description

Refactor code by meeting standards in web access and following the Scout rule.
Optimize the code base for long-term sustainability Ensure all links are working properly Clean CSS to make them more efficient Incorporate CSS selectors
and properties Organize them to follow the semantic structure of HTML elements Include comments before each element or section of the page
My motivation was my observation. I built this project because I actually liked the idea. made me figure out how the element actually works and where each element works appropriately.
it dose solve the factor element. In the project I learned where each element applies and how I can make the code look easy for the reader.
